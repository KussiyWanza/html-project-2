          <strong>Stuffed Mushrooms</strong>

      <h2>Main Courses</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong>

          <p>
            Salmon fillet seasoned and grilled to perfection, served with lemon
            butter sauce.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cedar-Plank Salmon</strong>

          <p>
            A big salmon fillet always feels like a festive main course,
            especially when it's cooked on a cedar grilling plank, so it picks
            up a whisper of smoky flavor. Kick off your seafood-themed dinner
            party with grilled oysters and pair the fish with a simple tomato
            salad.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grilled Pizza</strong>

          <p>
            Grilling pizza makes a main dish recipe into a party. This dough is
            designed for the grill—you can get creative with your toppings, or
            let your guests go wild. (Just don't get them started about whether
            you need New York tap water to make a superior slice.)
          </p>

      <h2>Desserts</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>

          <p>
            Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flowerless Chocolate Cake</strong>

          <p>
            Serve this elegant dessert to cap off a dinner party. A dollop of
            whipped cream on top is optional—ice cream or sorbet work well, too.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Butter Mochi</strong>

          <p>
            This perfectly chewy, slightly sticky, and just-dense-enough
            coconut-custard glutinous rice cake just wants you to slice off
            another sliver.
          </p>
        </li>
